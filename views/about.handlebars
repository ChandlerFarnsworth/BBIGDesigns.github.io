        <h2 class="display-6 fw-bold mb-4">How BBIG Designs Began</h2>
        <p>After years of purchasing the same old shirts, hats, and other merchandise from golf clubs all over the world, Greg Gibb and Garrett Farnsworth decided enough was enough. They worked together to come up with a product that was new and different, a quality product that would last. A product that would extend memories and evoke conversations forever.</p>
        <p>A 100% handcrafted belt buckle.</p>
        <p>A buckle that was fully customizable. A truly unique product that golf clubs could offer, and one that would last a lifetime. So, in 2013, BBIG Designs was born.</p>
        <p>Using exotic metals such as Nickel, Silver, Brass, and Copper, and an entire rainbow of colors, we are able to replicate club logos, which allows the club to sell a memory that will last. We can now offer tournament logos, school logos, and business logos, created with incredible accuracy and beauty.</p>
        <p>Because each of our buckles is 100% cut by hand, there is no minimum order required. Our quality is unmatched and instantly recognizable. BBIG Designs offers an item that you will be proud to put your logo on, proud to put your company name on, and proud to wear boldly. The possibilities for designs are endless as you can see in our galleries. Be uniqueâ€¦BBIG!</p>

        <h3 class="mb-4">Handcrafted Excellence</h3>
        <p>We start with two sheets of solid metal, one piece cut by hand with a jeweler's saw. Both pieces are brought together through a combination of multiple, arduous steps that include countless hours of polishing, sandpapering, texturing, wire brushing, and soldering; as well as adding resins, colors, metals, pearlescence, and/or hardening agents; all in a consistently controlled atmosphere of temperature and humidity.</p>
        <p>The finished product is brilliant. The lifetime guarantee reminds you of just how timeless your one-of-a-kind buckle will be.</p>

        <h3 class="mb-4">The BBIG Difference</h3>
        <p>For comparison reasons, look no further than a typical cast buckle. The process is done all by machine and can be duplicated time and time again. It takes minutes to make and costs pennies to process. So everyone can have the exact same buckle. Sounds boring to us!</p>
        <p>Our handcrafted approach ensures that each buckle is unique, with its own character and signature number. The attention to detail and quality of materials result in a product that stands the test of time.</p>
